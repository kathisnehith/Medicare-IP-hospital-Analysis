# Medicare-Inpatient-hospitals-Analysis/Report


## **Project Objective**
This project analyzes Medicare inpatient hospital discharges and payment data (2017â€“2022) to uncover trends in healthcare costs, provider performance, and geographic payment distributions. The goal was to provide actionable insights for understanding Medicare payment efficiency and patient cost trends using a dataset of over **1M records** from the [CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) website](https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-inpatient-hospitals/medicare-inpatient-hospitals-by-provider-and-service/data).

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains comprehensive information on inpatient hospital discharges, including:
- Diagnosis-related group (DRG) codes
- Total Medicare payments
- Average provider charges
- Out-of-pocket patient costs
- Geographic locations of providers

It serves as a vital resource for understanding healthcare utilization and financial metrics. 

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Update Frequency**: Updated annually to include the latest discharge data.
- **Format**: CSV files of each year.
- **Focus**: The analysis uses data from **2017 to 2022** to identify trends and insights in Medicare inpatient hospital services.

## **Key Findings**
The insights derived from the dashboard are outlined below; please refer to the [**Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/snehith.reddy.kathi/viz/medicare_inpatient_dashboard/Dashboard2) itself for a clearer and more interactive presentation of these findings.
### **Trends Over Time**
- Medicare payments and patient out-of-pocket expenses showed a steady increase from **2017 to 2022**, reflecting rising healthcare costs.
- While patient discharges remained stable initially, a **decline was observed post-2018**, indicating a shift in care delivery or reduced inpatient utilization.
- The number of participating providers also decreased during this period, signaling potential **industry consolidation** or reduced program participation.

### **Diagnosis Groups and Costs**
- **Infectious and Parasitic Diseases** accounted for the highest costs, with **$403M in Medicare payments** and **$450M in total costs**, emphasizing their financial impact.
- **Sepsis-related cases** were the most frequent diagnosis group, with over **3.5M discharges**, while **Tracheotomy with Mechanical Ventilation (>96 hours)** had the lowest, reflecting its specialized nature.
- The average Medicare payment per discharge varied significantly across diagnosis groups, highlighting the differences in treatment complexities and resource needs.

### **Geographic Disparities**
- States like **California ($47.9B)**, **New York ($37.15B)**, and **Florida ($30.59B)** had the highest Medicare payments due to larger populations and healthcare demand.
- **Wyoming ($0.43B)** and **Alaska ($0.11B)** reported the lowest expenditures, consistent with smaller populations and healthcare infrastructure.
- High-cost claims were concentrated in **metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 50,000**, underlining urban healthcare demand disparities.

### **Provider Performance**
- **New York Presbyterian Hospital** led Medicare payments at **$64.81M across 145,000 discharges**, showcasing its financial contribution to the program.
- **AdventHealth Orlando** reported the highest discharges (**149,000**), with **$27M in payments**, indicating cost efficiency for its case mix.
- Leading providers like **Massachusetts General Hospital**, **Mayo Clinic**, and **NYU Langone Hospitals** balanced discharge volumes and payments, highlighting their operational effectiveness.
